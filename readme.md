# Nice Weekend 🍪
> NiceWeekend is a minimal todo task tool to help out with your weekend planning and spend it the planned way.

#### Why NiceWeekend?
NiceWeekend was initially created as my weekend side project I created to improve my JS skills. It is functional To-Do list with a weekend counter on the top right.

I'm thinking of renaming it to Bad Weekend because its not that great.
